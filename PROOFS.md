# TABZ Proof Index (Mobile)

This file indexes proof artifacts and probes related to the mobile/web client.

## Y1/Y2 Notes (this chat)
- Repo was cleaned and backup trees removed.
- Untracked artifacts were quarantined outside the repo under:
  `C:\Users\troyl\TABZ-QUARANTINE\untracked-<timestamp>\`

## How to validate repo cleanliness
- `git status --porcelain` must be empty.

## Notes
This index intentionally contains no new logic—only pointers to where proof artifacts live.
